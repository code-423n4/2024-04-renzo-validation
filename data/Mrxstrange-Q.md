## Front-runnable Initializers

* All contract initializers were missing access controls, allowing any user to initialize the contract. By front-running the contract deployers to initialize the contract, the incorrect parameters may be supplied, leaving the contract needing to be redeployed.

## Proof of Concept

Navigate to the following contracts:

Initialize functions does not have access control. They are vulnerable to front-running.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

* While the code that can be run in contract constructors is limited, setting the owner in the contractâ€™s constructor to the msg.sender and adding the onlyOwner modifier to all initializers would be a sufficient level of access control.
