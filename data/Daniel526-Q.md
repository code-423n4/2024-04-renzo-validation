## A. Reentrancy Vulnerability in `_withdraw` Function
[XERC20Lockbox.sol#L125-L136](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/519e518f2d8dec9acf6482b84a181e403070d22d/contracts/Bridge/xERC20/contracts/XERC20Lockbox.sol#L125-L136)
In the `_withdraw` function, the contract emits a `Withdraw` event, burns the specified amount of XERC20 tokens from the caller's balance, and then interacts with external contracts to transfer tokens or native assets. However, the interaction step occurs before the effect step, which violates the Check-Effect-Interact (CEI) pattern, potentially leading to a reentrancy vulnerability.
### Impact:
This vulnerability could enable malicious actors to exploit reentrancy attacks. By calling back into the contract before the effect step (burning tokens) is completed, attackers could manipulate the contract's state, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

### Mitigation:

To address this vulnerability, we need to ensure that interactions with external contracts occur after completing the effect step (burning tokens). This sequence helps prevent reentrancy attacks by updating the contract's state before interacting with external entities.

## B. Lack of Safe ERC20 Transfer Usage in claim Function
[WithdrawQueue.sol#L279-L313](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/519e518f2d8dec9acf6482b84a181e403070d22d/contracts/Withdraw/WithdrawQueue.sol#L279-L313)
The `claim` function in the `WithdrawQueue` contract currently utilizes the transfer function for ERC20 token transfers, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the case of ERC20 token transfers, using transfer does not perform a check to ensure the transfer was successful. This lack of checking can result in the loss of tokens or denial of service if the transfer fails, which may occur due to various reasons such as insufficient gas or contract restrictions.

### Impact:
The absence of a check for the success of ERC20 token transfers using `transfer` in the `claim` function could lead to funds being lost or stuck within the contract, affecting user experience and potentially causing financial losses.

### Mitigation:
To address this vulnerability, it's crucial to replace the usage of transfer with `safeTransfer` from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library. `safeTransfer` ensures that the ERC20 token transfer is executed securely by reverting the transaction if the transfer fails
